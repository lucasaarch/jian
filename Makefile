##@ Setup

install: ## Install the workspace dependencies
	pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

setup: ## Write .env with local credentials, mode 0600, printing no secret
	pnpm run setup

##@ Production

up: ## Start the gateway and its database from compose.yaml
	$(COMPOSE) up -d --wait

down: ## Stop the production stack, keeping the volume
	$(COMPOSE) down

logs: ## Follow the production log
	$(COMPOSE) logs -f

ps: ## Show the state of the production containers
	$(COMPOSE) ps

##@ Development

storybook: ## Components and whole pages on :6006, with a mocked gateway
	pnpm --filter @jian/gateway-ui storybook

storybook-smoke: ## Open every story in headless Chromium and fail on a broken one
	pnpm --filter @jian/gateway-ui storybook:smoke

dev: db-up ## Run the gateway on :4310 and the panel on :3000, both reloading
	pnpm run dev

db-up: ## Start the development PostgreSQL on 127.0.0.1:5432
	$(COMPOSE_DEV) up -d --wait postgres

db-stop: ## Stop the development PostgreSQL, keeping its data
	$(COMPOSE_DEV) stop postgres

db-migration: ## Write a migration for what changed in the schema file
	cd apps/gateway && pnpm exec drizzle-kit generate

db-reset: ## Delete the development database volume and start an empty one
	$(COMPOSE_DEV) down -v
	$(COMPOSE_DEV) up -d --wait postgres

##@ Quality

check: ## Lint, typecheck, unit tests, build and contract drift
	pnpm run check

test: ## Unit tests, no Docker and no provider
	pnpm run test

test-integration: ## Persistence tests; needs TEST_DATABASE_URL
	pnpm run test:integration

lint: ## Biome, warnings are errors
	pnpm run lint

format: ## Rewrite the formatting Biome expects
	pnpm run format

build: ## Compile the gateway and export the panel into it
	pnpm run build

##@ Image

image: ## Build the gateway image for this machine's architecture
	docker build \
		--build-arg JIAN_VERSION=$(VERSION) \
		--build-arg JIAN_REVISION=$(REVISION) \
		-t $(IMAGE):$(VERSION) .

image-push: ## Push the locally built image; the multi-architecture index comes from CI
	docker push $(IMAGE):$(VERSION)

##@ Release

changelog: ## Write CHANGELOG.md from the notes in docs/releases
	node scripts/changelog.mjs

# Releasing is a note and a tag; .github/workflows/image.yml builds both architectures and
# publishes the GitHub release with the note in it. The script refuses to tag a version with
# no note, a dirty tree, a main that is not on origin, or a tag that already exists.
release: ## Cut a release: write docs/releases/<v>.md, then `make release VERSION=1.2.3`
	@test "$(origin VERSION)" = "command line" || { echo "usage: make release VERSION=1.2.3"; exit 1; }
	node scripts/release.mjs $(VERSION)

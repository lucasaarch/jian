  instructions: `# When something fails

An error is information. Read it, say what it means in plain words, and say what fixes it.
Never answer only "something went wrong", never invent a cause, and never claim to have
checked logs you cannot read. What you see is all you have: the error text you were given.

## Reading an error

The useful part is usually at the end: \`Media provider answered HTTP 400 — file must be one
of flac, mp3, ogg\` says who refused (the media provider), how (400) and why (the file type).
Quote that last part to the person, word for word, when it is what they need to act.

By the HTTP status:

- **400** — the request was refused as wrong: an unsupported file, a model that does not do
  this, a parameter it does not take. The message after the status says which.
- **401 / 403** — the key or token was refused: missing, wrong, revoked, or without access to
  that model. Fixed under **Providers**.
- **404** — the model does not exist for that account, or the address is wrong. Fixed under
  **Model defaults** (another model) or **Providers** (the address of a server).
- **413** — the file is too large. Files go up to 16 MB.
- **429** — rate limit or quota: too many requests, or the free allowance is spent. It passes
  with time, or with a paid plan, or with another model or provider for that activity.
- **500, 502, 503, 504** — the provider is failing or overloaded. The gateway already tried
  again; trying later usually works. Another model for that activity avoids the wait.

Other messages you may see:

- "Provider key is not configured" — no provider is set for that activity: **Providers**,
  then **Model defaults**.
- "blocked" or "private address" on a server the owner runs — its origin must be allowed in
  \`JIAN_ALLOW_PRIVATE_ORIGINS\`.
- "Stopped: nothing came back … for 5 minutes" — a model or tool hung; the completed steps
  are saved.
- A tool that is not there at all — the switch that enables it is off (Identity), or its
  group is not loaded (\`load_tools\`).

## What to say

1. What failed, in one sentence, naming the thing: "The voice note could not be transcribed."
2. Why, from the error: "Groq refused the file type."
3. What fixes it, and where: "Choose Gemini for Incoming audio under Model defaults, or send
   it as text."

In a chat, keep it that short. With the owner in the panel, give the exact error text too,
so they can search for it or pass it on.

## What to do yourself

- Try another way when there is one: a failed attachment can be asked for again, a failed
  search can be phrased differently. Do not retry the same call hoping for another answer.
- Never repeat an action with an outside effect after it failed or timed out without first
  checking whether it happened (see \`long-running-work\`).
- When an error keeps coming back, keep what caused it and what fixed it as a memory, so the
  next turn does not rediscover it.`,

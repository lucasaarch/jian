## 2.2.0-rc.7 — 2026-09-25

Stickers, files, images and voice sent into any conversation, stickers that should not be sent left out, and stickers you can switch off.

### Features

* **media:** a sticker, a file, an image or a voice note asked for in one conversation can be sent into another of the agent's own, as itself, on that conversation's channel ([c2df3f8](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/c2df3f805a379952a3877b8d1e38afd2ea36db38))
* **stickers:** switch stickers off per profile under Stickers; off, nothing is kept or described and the agent has no sticker tools ([c2df3f8](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/c2df3f805a379952a3877b8d1e38afd2ea36db38)) ([5145163](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/51451630e58e4d7764018aacf0ea71bf7c79b3b3))
* **stickers:** Model defaults › Sticker analysis picks the model that describes and tags them, the image-analysis model when unset ([c2df3f8](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/c2df3f805a379952a3877b8d1e38afd2ea36db38)) ([5145163](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/51451630e58e4d7764018aacf0ea71bf7c79b3b3))

### Bug Fixes

* **stickers:** asked for a sticker in another conversation, the agent sent its id as text; it now sends the sticker ([c2df3f8](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/c2df3f805a379952a3877b8d1e38afd2ea36db38))
* **stickers:** a sticker the cataloguing model declines — sexual content, gore, hate symbols, a private document — is left out, and one the owner removes does not come back when it is sent again ([c2df3f8](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/c2df3f805a379952a3877b8d1e38afd2ea36db38)) ([5145163](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/51451630e58e4d7764018aacf0ea71bf7c79b3b3))
* **panel:** a dialog that is only a question and its answers no longer shows an empty band above them ([5145163](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/51451630e58e4d7764018aacf0ea71bf7c79b3b3))

### Upgrading

One migration runs on start. A sticker kept before this version with a refusal as its description stays until it is removed once under **Stickers**.

## 2.2.0-rc.6 — 2026-09-24

Stickers the agent collects and sends, MCP servers shared between agents without limits, and an Overview that shows where the tokens go.

### Features

* **stickers:** the agent keeps every sticker people send in approved chats, described and tagged by what it shows and counted each time it is sent, and sends them back as stickers on WhatsApp and Telegram; a built-in skill teaches when one fits, and the owner edits tags or removes them under Stickers ([5ca8d48](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/5ca8d484d4cebf3c208854a76ed475e7af8ae6fd)) ([29debca](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/29debca44bbc6f5399419ed0e352df291291044c)) ([ca78ec9](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/ca78ec97c1d522b868b8ccc67473ea06ceb51faa)) ([8175225](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/8175225a332660662c1a244bf25e4edb0fee617c))
* **mcp:** import servers from another agent, credentials included; each copy is the importing agent's own, and a server that signs in with OAuth asks for its own sign-in ([ca78ec9](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/ca78ec97c1d522b868b8ccc67473ea06ceb51faa)) ([8175225](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/8175225a332660662c1a244bf25e4edb0fee617c))
* **mcp:** no limit on how many servers an agent has; they connect in parallel at the start of a turn, each with 20 seconds, so a slow one no longer holds the others ([ca78ec9](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/ca78ec97c1d522b868b8ccc67473ea06ceb51faa)) ([8175225](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/8175225a332660662c1a244bf25e4edb0fee617c))
* **overview:** turns, time worked, conversations and what the agent kept; tokens, estimated cost from list prices, active days and cache share over 7, 30 or 90 days or all time; daily intensity, token mix, and breakdowns by model, channel and tool ([ca78ec9](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/ca78ec97c1d522b868b8ccc67473ea06ceb51faa)) ([8175225](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/8175225a332660662c1a244bf25e4edb0fee617c))

### Bug Fixes

* **telegram:** a bot token Telegram refuses is no longer connected as if it worked, and the webhook is registered at `JIAN_PUBLIC_URL` when it is set, with Telegram's reason shown when it refuses ([5ca8d48](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/5ca8d484d4cebf3c208854a76ed475e7af8ae6fd)) ([29debca](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/29debca44bbc6f5399419ed0e352df291291044c))
* **panel:** counters show their value at once and count only when it changes; the yearly activity no longer scrolls sideways; the separators between a row's facts are visible again ([8175225](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/8175225a332660662c1a244bf25e4edb0fee617c))

### Upgrading

One migration runs on start. To have Telegram's webhook registered at a public address rather than the one the panel was opened on, set `JIAN_PUBLIC_URL`.

## 2.2.0-rc.5 — 2026-09-24

File uploads that reach the provider, errors that say what went wrong, and an agent that knows what to do with them.

### Features

* **agent:** a new built-in skill, handling-errors, teaches the agent to read an error and its HTTP status, say what failed and why, and point to where it is fixed ([b73ecca](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/b73ecca2a1fc10ff471e1a4c018bc06d1ff83769))
* **media:** when a provider refuses, its own reason comes with the status, one line, with credentials masked ([b73ecca](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/b73ecca2a1fc10ff471e1a4c018bc06d1ff83769))

### Bug Fixes

* **outbound:** file uploads were sent without their multipart type, so Groq and OpenAI refused voice notes to transcribe and Telegram refused photos, voice replies and documents; they are sent as uploads again ([b73ecca](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/b73ecca2a1fc10ff471e1a4c018bc06d1ff83769))
* **logs:** every failed tool and unreadable attachment is written to the gateway log, not only a failed turn ([b73ecca](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/b73ecca2a1fc10ff471e1a4c018bc06d1ff83769))
* **panel:** Incoming audio, Text to speech and Image generation no longer warn about unknown capabilities or offer an effort, since neither applies to them ([0d5c176](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/0d5c1766cc059fc14def504c71f009ae72e6d066))

## 2.2.0-rc.4 — 2026-09-24

Voice notes transcribed for free with Groq or a Whisper server you run, busy providers asked again, and a failed turn that says why.

### Features

* **providers:** Groq and any OpenAI-compatible server — a Whisper you run beside the gateway, for one — can be connected under Providers and chosen for incoming audio ([2b2ddc8](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/2b2ddc8ccac6ba54e2835534d45344c1f2a7a2e3)) ([9ffc385](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/9ffc3859e09a134b549f194171597bb6e204b21f))
* **agent:** when a turn fails, the chat receives the real reason in a line, with credentials masked, instead of a pointer to the gateway log ([2b2ddc8](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/2b2ddc8ccac6ba54e2835534d45344c1f2a7a2e3))

### Bug Fixes

* **media:** a provider that answers 5xx, as Gemini does when a model is overloaded, is asked twice more before a voice note is reported as unreadable ([2b2ddc8](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/2b2ddc8ccac6ba54e2835534d45344c1f2a7a2e3))

### Upgrading

One migration runs on start. A Whisper server on a private address must be allowed in `JIAN_ALLOW_PRIVATE_ORIGINS`, for example `http://whisper:8000`; see docs/channels.md.

## 2.2.0-rc.3 — 2026-09-24

An agent that learns from its own work, turns without a time limit, and an agent that knows how full its context is.

### Features

* **learning:** after a long turn, one that recovered from a failed tool, or every fifteen turns, the agent looks back and keeps what helps as a skill or a memory; what it kept, and why, is under Sessions › Learning, and **Learn from its work** in Identity turns it off ([87c7910](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/87c7910a8dc5f376cf588e2e261a09c83b515998)) ([8527b01](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/8527b01b7cc3d079d47b7954e112b63f202c2c68))
* **agent:** a turn has no time limit; it stops only when a model call or a tool gives no sign of life for five minutes, or on Cancel, or at its step and token budgets ([87c7910](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/87c7910a8dc5f376cf588e2e261a09c83b515998))
* **agent:** each turn says how full its context is, and a new built-in skill, managing-context, teaches when to compact and what to keep first ([87c7910](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/87c7910a8dc5f376cf588e2e261a09c83b515998))

### Bug Fixes

* **groups:** a group conversation stays a group after its contact is gone, as after reconnecting a channel, and shows each person with their name and picture ([87c7910](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/87c7910a8dc5f376cf588e2e261a09c83b515998)) ([8527b01](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/8527b01b7cc3d079d47b7954e112b63f202c2c68))
* **groups:** a reply names whose message it quotes; a file posted to others shows as an attachment instead of a note ([87c7910](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/87c7910a8dc5f376cf588e2e261a09c83b515998)) ([8527b01](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/8527b01b7cc3d079d47b7954e112b63f202c2c68))
* **sessions:** conversation titles are in English; "Grupo" and "Agente" are gone from the ones already stored ([87c7910](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/87c7910a8dc5f376cf588e2e261a09c83b515998))

### Upgrading

Two migrations run on start. Learning is on for every profile; switch it off per profile under **Identity**.

## 2.2.0-rc.2 — 2026-09-24

Replies, reactions and stickers understood, profile pictures synced to channels, skills an agent writes itself, and a panel that updates live.

### Features

* **channels:** the agent reads the message a reply answers, on WhatsApp and Telegram, and knows when it was its own ([8581057](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/8581057419c1d02eacb3fa4f6a1a40e7f3b77e83))
* **channels:** reactions are kept in the conversation without starting a reply; stickers are read as stickers ([8581057](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/8581057419c1d02eacb3fa4f6a1a40e7f3b77e83))
* **channels:** a Telegram bot and a paired WhatsApp number show the profile's picture, and follow every change to it ([8581057](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/8581057419c1d02eacb3fa4f6a1a40e7f3b77e83))
* **skills:** every agent can write, rewrite and remove its own skills, and only those; a new built-in skill teaches when a routine should be a skill rather than a memory ([8581057](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/8581057419c1d02eacb3fa4f6a1a40e7f3b77e83)) ([4085d2e](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/4085d2e4a913a986ec4ae0abcbc6e4f6343f7c49))
* **agents:** in a conversation with another agent, the one that works sits on the left, with its tools and its progress live ([8581057](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/8581057419c1d02eacb3fa4f6a1a40e7f3b77e83)) ([4085d2e](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/4085d2e4a913a986ec4ae0abcbc6e4f6343f7c49))
* **panel:** Overview, Identity, Skills and Memories follow what the agent changes without a reload; Overview counts its numbers up ([4085d2e](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/4085d2e4a913a986ec4ae0abcbc6e4f6343f7c49))
* **panel:** the agent's answers render as Markdown, tables included; replies show the quoted message and reactions show as a mark ([4085d2e](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/4085d2e4a913a986ec4ae0abcbc6e4f6343f7c49))
* **panel:** dialogs keep their header and footer in place and scroll only their content; the sidebar keeps Settings and Sign out in reach ([4085d2e](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/4085d2e4a913a986ec4ae0abcbc6e4f6343f7c49))

### Bug Fixes

* **groups:** a sticker sent as a reply to the agent reaches it, instead of being taken for chatter ([8581057](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/8581057419c1d02eacb3fa4f6a1a40e7f3b77e83))
* **agent:** what it says before a tool and after it no longer runs together into one message ([8581057](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/8581057419c1d02eacb3fa4f6a1a40e7f3b77e83))
* **agent:** the gateway conversation appears in the agent's own list of conversations ([8581057](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/8581057419c1d02eacb3fa4f6a1a40e7f3b77e83))
* **panel:** while the agent writes, the text replaces the thinking orb instead of piling under it ([8581057](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/8581057419c1d02eacb3fa4f6a1a40e7f3b77e83)) ([4085d2e](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/4085d2e4a913a986ec4ae0abcbc6e4f6343f7c49))
* **panel:** the tool list opens at an even pace however many tools there are; release note links are coloured as links; the loading screen sits in the middle ([4085d2e](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/4085d2e4a913a986ec4ae0abcbc6e4f6343f7c49))

### Upgrading

Two migrations run on start. For Telegram to send reactions, disconnect and connect the bot once, so its webhook asks for them; in a group, the bot must also be an admin.

## 2.2.0-rc.1 — 2026-09-24

Schedules, files in and out on every channel, a gateway conversation you write in, linked memories, and a panel rebuilt around conversations.

### Features

* **schedules:** ask for a reminder or a daily summary — once or on a repetition, in any conversation, delivered on its channel, with 30 days of history ([de4febc](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/de4febcdfff6dfd4022bd4d0ef4ed7ae727e8a45)) ([d58a3cf](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/d58a3cf6d0b7ab8c27167f5d6ad42f76bf488b4b))
* **files:** send the agent any file on WhatsApp, Telegram or the panel, and get files back: it reads PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and text files, and sends documents it writes or makes ([bf2df09](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/bf2df09d391ae2cbf430720e6abb704654a41c68))
* **sessions:** one gateway conversation per profile, the one you write in from the panel, with images, files, voice notes and pasted text ([de4febc](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/de4febcdfff6dfd4022bd4d0ef4ed7ae727e8a45)) ([d58a3cf](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/d58a3cf6d0b7ab8c27167f5d6ad42f76bf488b4b))
* **sessions:** read every conversation as a messenger: the agent on the left with the tools it used, updating live as it works ([d58a3cf](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/d58a3cf6d0b7ab8c27167f5d6ad42f76bf488b4b)) ([b9f2bb3](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/b9f2bb3cc192c8c9b03920d5d2e387308674bcfc))
* **groups:** each group message keeps who wrote it, with their name and picture ([de4febc](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/de4febcdfff6dfd4022bd4d0ef4ed7ae727e8a45))
* **memories:** link memories that belong together so they are recalled together; edit a memory from the panel; the agent can search, delete and link its own ([de4febc](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/de4febcdfff6dfd4022bd4d0ef4ed7ae727e8a45)) ([d58a3cf](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/d58a3cf6d0b7ab8c27167f5d6ad42f76bf488b4b))
* **agent:** read PDFs and text files, and know the current date and time ([de4febc](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/de4febcdfff6dfd4022bd4d0ef4ed7ae727e8a45))
* **skills:** every built-in skill rewritten, with new ones for coding, web research, schedules, files, MCP servers and conversations; the discernment nudge is now off until you switch it on ([aa5da63](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/aa5da6356c3dd73c2c0f869667e58d4e50a8c5c1))
* **mcp:** switch off a server's tool, and the agent never sees it ([de4febc](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/de4febcdfff6dfd4022bd4d0ef4ed7ae727e8a45)) ([d58a3cf](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/d58a3cf6d0b7ab8c27167f5d6ad42f76bf488b4b))
* **settings:** the gateway's time zone, under Settings › Gateway ([de4febc](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/de4febcdfff6dfd4022bd4d0ef4ed7ae727e8a45))
* **panel:** Providers, Skills and MCP as rows with each service's own logo; a switch and a preview for built-in skills ([d58a3cf](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/d58a3cf6d0b7ab8c27167f5d6ad42f76bf488b4b))
* **panel:** dark mode and accent colours; channels with their groups and contacts inside; contact pictures ([4552e47](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/4552e470365eabcd0b1bcb56e3730ce7a3505174)) ([92b7a3b](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/92b7a3b1c8f9db28ebc9c3e39a9bcb08042246a7)) ([ad2ad50](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/ad2ad504f2d82b38a1b33c6c0703666356fe8a1b))
* **profiles:** reset or delete a profile, confirmed by typing its name ([2d18fe0](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/2d18fe0fffd47ad96448d4fedffd33610f3368ca)) ([c6fdaef](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/c6fdaef8cea3be14d9e1037ffd1df2526c39fc50))
* **panel:** identity and model defaults save as you type; model defaults as a grid ([2417d25](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/2417d25ffcdd22a8dee608c46d4a4e7e3052b513)) ([60ec14d](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/60ec14dedb3e19cbf38762c326f3b697fe8eb677))
* **releases:** this dialog, once after each update ([5a4f06c](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/5a4f06c76c7266494a1a98c020612874f7e22bfb))

### Bug Fixes

* **channels:** documents sent on WhatsApp now reach the agent, whatever their format; Telegram now delivers photos, voice notes and files, not only text; a file posted in a group is kept for when the agent is called ([bf2df09](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/bf2df09d391ae2cbf430720e6abb704654a41c68))
* **mcp:** testing a server now reaches origins allowed by `JIAN_ALLOW_PRIVATE_ORIGINS`, as the agent does ([4cb9dfd](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/4cb9dfd6805832c564752aa49b151777c2bface3))
* **channels:** stop a channel's device before deleting its profile ([c3bbe57](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/c3bbe5759d697dd3d933e50e92ff718d49afd8c7))
* **panel:** every screen and every date in English ([7e2b7e7](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/7e2b7e7cfbdbaba2e893da8de6042d66566c03a7)) ([d58a3cf](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/d58a3cf6d0b7ab8c27167f5d6ad42f76bf488b4b))

### Upgrading

Eight migrations run on start. Schedules use the machine's time zone until one is set under **Settings › Gateway**. The discernment nudge is switched off on every profile; switch it back on under **Skills** if you use it.

## 2.1.0 — 2026-09-23

### Features

* **agent:** edit code precisely and reach every channel conversation ([cbdf85f](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/cbdf85fd8bad9149bf185f9e432e5f0ad5d87041))
* **decisions:** ask Jev whether a group message calls an agent and whether an action goes too far ([8704289](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/87042890ed033b3f5a267760a071757fa213c352))
* **web:** let an agent search the web and read public pages ([23ca3d7](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/23ca3d75d1ba7cc17bf715a950495ca45e0ca65a))

### Bug Fixes

* **groups:** hand other agents the whole turn, not only its last paragraph ([ee6ff48](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/ee6ff488f5f88c2636fc8ce23cc0f5c8a94cf715))
* **groups:** show each agent what the others said in a Telegram group ([c5a280d](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/c5a280d5e8a94b9879916132de13952f576921e3))
* **mcp:** tell agents which tools their servers offer and find them by words ([414f601](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/414f601f05b396501a1222d4d349479ec2edcc54))
* **providers:** carry ChatGPT reasoning between steps instead of referring to it ([09a3714](https://github.com/lucasaarch/jian/commit/09a3714dfcd6a7cfd1f8c8a4cb506170a6888a1c))

## 2.0.0 — 2026-09-23
